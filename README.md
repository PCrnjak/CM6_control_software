# CM6_control_software
CM6_control_software
CM6_control_software allows "easy" programming of CM6 robot. GUI software was written in python and heavily relies on Peter Corke's robotic toolbox for python! It was tested on Linux virtual machine, laptop running Linux, and raspberry pi 4!

The software offers real-time monitoring of robots:

* Motor position, current, speed, temperature
* End effector position
* Operating modes, errors...
* 
Available modes at this moment are:

* Individual motor jogging 
* freehand teach 
* move from point to point 

Each of these modes of movement can be recorded and replayed!
